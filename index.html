We often hear the  term ‘Cricket is a religion in India and Sachin is God’. No better statement  can justify the status of cricket and  Sachin Tendulkar in India. Though there were many great cricketers before Sachin Tendulkar, his  transition story has  inspired many people to work on their dreams.
